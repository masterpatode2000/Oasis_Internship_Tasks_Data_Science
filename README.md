Hi There,
1. IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differ according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.

Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine Learning.

2. EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

We've all been the recipients of spam emails before. Spam mail, or junk mail, is a type of email that is sent to a massive number of users at one time, frequently containing cryptic messages, scams, or most dangerously, phishing content.

In this Project, use Python to build an email spam detector. Then, use machine learning to train the spam detector to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam. Let's get started!

3. SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.

Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. So let's start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
